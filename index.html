            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Jamaica and came here to America when I was 8 years old. Since then I've always driven myself to be the best in anything I do. That mindset first led me to pursuing a degree in political science but however I've always been intrested in the internet and how it works from the back end. Now at 32 years old I've decided to take those thoughts and make them a realality.
